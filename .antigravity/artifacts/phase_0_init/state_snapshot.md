# State Snapshot - Phase 0: Initialization

**Current Date**: 2026-02-02
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Completed Actions
- Scanned workspace and identified full-stack architecture (Laravel + Next.js + Docker).
- Established `.antigravity/` governance structure.
- Documented "coding fingerprint" in `learned_standards.md`.
- Created `feedback_loop.md` for continuous learning.

## Known Project Context
- **Project Name**: Silver AI
- **Primary Goal**: Migrate legacy PHP AI logic to Laravel API + Next.js frontend.
- **Key Modules**:
    - `laravel-backend`: API, RBAC, AI Services (Cloudflare Workers AI).
    - `nextjs-app`: Modernized frontend (ported from `nextjs-frontend`).
- **Critical Files**:
    - `SilverAIService.php`: Core AI integration logic.
    - `aiGatewayService.ts`: Frontend-Backend bridge.
    - `PLAN.md`: Strategic roadmap.

## Active Phase
- **Phase 0**: Environment Initialization (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 1**: Foundations & Refinement (CURRENT)

## Physical File Verification
- [x] `.antigravity/` exists
- [x] `learned_standards.md` reflects current code style
- [x] Directory structure is mapped
