we're going to replicate the alamia-ai-hub for Silver Ant Marketing (a full service digital marketing agency)

So rename all the clases/branding etc

I'll update CF AI gateway hub urls after seting up on CF.

silver-ai will be hosted on one of our subdomains and will be used as a "ai inference provider service" for our in-house products + products that are under development right now which include Stratos - an Agency OS (with modules for staff workspaces (web, smm, ppc, seo, content etc) hr, finance, project management, crm etc) and a wp plugin Silver Nova that provides SEO, AEO and AIVO under one platform; so these products will be talking to the silver-ai.

Also for showing to the chairman we need to setup a chat interface with Silver Ant's branding; this will be a progress update as well
